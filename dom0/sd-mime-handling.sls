# sd-mime-handling
# =====================
#
# Overrides mimetype handling for certain VMs. Instead of relying on the
# /usr/share/applications (system volume), we instead use /home/user/.local/share/
# (private volume). The various mimeapps.list files linked are provided by the
# securedrop-workstation-config package in /opt/, and are symlinked here in their
# respective AppVMs.
